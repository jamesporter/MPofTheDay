In 2007, Tony Blair resigned as Prime Minister and Labour Leader and Brown was chosen to replace him in an uncontested election. On 11 May 2010, Brown officially resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party.  She was the daughter of John Souter, a timber merchant.  At age sixteen he wrote that he loathed and resented this \"ludicrous\" experiment on young lives.  He served as Rector until 1975, and also edited the document The Red Paper on Scotland. His first Westminster office mate was a newly elected MP from the Sedgefield constituency by the name of Tony Blair. After the sudden death of Labour leader John Smith in May 1994, Brown did not contest the leadership after Tony Blair became favourite, deciding to make way for Blair to avoiding splitting the pro-modernising vote in the leadership ..."
